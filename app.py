        Did you know that machine learning models can help you
        predict heart disease pretty accurately? In this app, you can
        estimate your chance of heart disease (yes/no) in seconds!
        
        Here, a logistic regression model using an undersampling technique
        was constructed using survey data of over 300k US residents from the year 2020.
        This application is based on it because it has proven to be better than the random forest
        (it achieves an accuracy of about 80%, which is quite good).
        
        To predict your heart disease status, simply follow the steps bellow:
        1. Enter the parameters that best describe you;
        2. Press the "Predict" button and wait for the result.
            
        **Keep in mind that this results is not equivalent to a medical diagnosis!
        This model would never be adopted by health care facilities because of its less
        than perfect accuracy, so if you have any problems, consult a human doctor.**
        
        **Author: Kamil Pytlak ([GitHub](https://github.com/kamilpytlak/heart-condition-checker))**
        
        You can see the steps of building the model, evaluating it, and cleaning the data itself
        on my GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/kamilpytlak/data-analyses/tree/main/heart-disease-prediction).
